      <h2>Hey there you, welcome.</h2>
      <p class="intro-blurb">The last couple of years have presented many challenges, but it also has
        presented many opportunities. For myself, the biggest opportunity was being
        able to ask myself the question "What direction do I want to take in life?"
        <br><br>
        Life giving me the time to really tackle the question and find my own answer
        was a great opportunity and I decided to grab the bull by the horns.
        <br><br>
        I have recently taken a leap to entirely focus on studying Python in the
         hope that I can find my way into a new career that scratches my problem
         solving itch.
